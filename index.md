# A Taste of Freedom
But, like most politicians, he promised more than he could deliver. Anyone who laughs is a communist! Oh, I always feared he might run off like this. Why, why, why didn't I break his legs?

### Hell Is Other Robots
I just told you! You've killed me! Oh right. I forgot about the battle. Ow, my spirit! I guess because my parents keep telling me to be more ladylike. As though!

* I suppose I could part with 'one' and still be feared...
* Five hours? Aw, man! Couldn't you just get me the death penalty?
* When the lights go out, it's nobody's business what goes on between two consenting adults.

### A Clockwork Origin
I am Singing Wind, Chief of the Martians. And from now on you're all named Bender Jr. Hello Morbo, how's the family? Yeah, I do that with my stupidness. But I know you in the future. I cleaned your poop.

#### Bendin' in the Wind
Anyhoo, your net-suits will allow you to experience Fry's worm infested bowels as if you were actually wriggling through them. In our darkest hour, we can stand erect, with proud upthrust bosoms. I love you, buddy! Shut up and take my money! Soothe us with sweet lies.

1. Are you crazy? I can't swallow that.
2. You'll have all the Slurm you can drink when you're partying with Slurms McKenzie!
3. I suppose I could part with 'one' and still be feared...

Here is an example of AppleScript:

    tell application "Foo"
        beep
    end tell

##### Spanish Fry
Who are you, my warranty?! Bender, being God isn't easy. If you do too much, people get dependent on you, and if you do nothing, they lose hope. You have to use a light touch. Like a safecracker, or a pickpocket. I'm Santa Claus! And remember, don't do anything that affects anything, unless it turns out you were supposed to, in which case, for the love of God, don't not do it! Kif might! Dear God, they'll be killed on our doorstep! And there's no trash pickup until January 3rd.
