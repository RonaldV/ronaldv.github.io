Who I am is a rather philosophical question and can't be answered in a few sentences. But if asked most of us tend to answer by what we do. I think the concept is that we live in an action oriented world. Words are cheap and what we do is what defines us. But that is not who we are.

But to keep up with the idea.

> Actions speak louder than words.

I give you the action with the words. I write some software, I play a little guitar, I climb a few walls and the rest of the time I try to dance around at the beat of life.
